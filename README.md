# Eight queens puzzle

The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The eight queens puzzle is an example of the more general n queens problem of placing n non-attacking queens on an n×n chessboard, for which solutions exist for all natural numbers n with the exception of n = 2 and n = 3

It was implemented as homework for an AI discipline in the 90's, just for fun. 

# Algorithm

The heuristic search algorithm is simple and explores a limited number of network structures. On the other hand, the exhaustive search algorithm is complex and explores many possible network structures.
